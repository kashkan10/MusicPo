I'm leaving my hometown tonight.
There's nothing you can say.
I feel ready to say goodbye.
Nothing would make me stay.
Leaving my hometown tonight.
The wind will be my guide.
As long as my eyes can bear the light.
Livin' at the pace of the tide.
I'll go so far you won't find me.
I'll free my mind.
You'll try and try but won't catch me.
Because the road is calling me.
Leaving everything I know is fine.
Time to start again.
If I lose myself I've tried.
I will break the chain.
I'll go so far you won't find me.
I'll free my mind.
You'll try and try but won't catch me.
Because the road is calling me.
I'll go so far you won't find me.
I'll free my mind.
You'll try and try bot won't catch me.
Because the road is calling me.
